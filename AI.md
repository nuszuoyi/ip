### Tools Used
- GitHub Copilot

### Usage Record

#### Increment 1: Basic Task List & Command Parsing
- Copilot generated the initial structure for the main class and command parsing logic.

#### Increment 2: OOP Refactoring (Task, ToDo, Deadline, Event)
- Copilot generated base and derived classes for tasks, including constructors and `toString` methods.

#### Increment 3: Mark/Unmark/Delete Features
- Copilot assisted with exception handling templates for mark, unmark, and delete commands.

#### Increment 4: Enum Introduction
- Copilot helped propagate `TaskType` enum usage across relevant classes.

#### Increment 5: Test Input/Output
- Copilot generated initial `input.txt` and `EXPECTED.TXT` test files.

### Observations
- Copilot is useful for repetitive code and OOP scaffolding.
- Complex logic and output formatting were manually implemented.
- Overall, Copilot saved time on boilerplate code while I maintained full control over core logic.
